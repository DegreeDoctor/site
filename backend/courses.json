This course is designed to introduce students to methods of visualizing many different types of data, such as images, three-dimensional surfaces, flow fields, and medical data. Both existing visualization software and program custom visualizations using C++ and OpenGL will be used. Course activities include discussion of recent and classic research papers, weekly homework assignments, in-class critiques of visualization artifacts, and a final project to explore creative uses of these techniques. This is a communication-intensive course.",

Thus, analytics is an entire methodology rather than individual analyses or analysis steps.",
