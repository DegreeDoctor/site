Scraper is reaching the maximum recursion depth while I try to get all of the information.
I have removed all scraping except for the subject grabbing portion to see if the problem is somewhere
in one of the more complicated scrapers. If it is able to run to completion with just this, that will inform me
I need to look closely at the other sections of my scraper. Its just so god forsakingly slow that testing anything 
fills me with dread.
