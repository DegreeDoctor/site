Course Description: Digital gaming is one of the most rapidly developing fields. The effort required for developing games is not trivial. To make a game fun to play, the design of the game levels and/or the AI-driven opponents need to be intelligent and adaptive to the players’ strategies and skills. In this course, students will learn and explore using machine learning techniques to automate the design process of digital games. The course will cover basic and advanced topics in Artificial Intelligence and Learning, such as Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms, and Reinforcement Learning. Students will gain hands-on experience in applying these techniques in computer games. The course will also introduce psychological theories and studies about people’s decision-making and emotional processes and how they are related to the players’ experience in games. This course will take the form of a combination of lectures, presentations by students, class discussions, and independent study.

Course Description: Digital gaming is one of the most rapidly developing fields. The effort required for developing games is not trivial. To make a game fun to play, the design of the game levels and/or the AI-driven opponents need to be intelligent and adaptive to the players’ strategies and skills. In this course, students will learn and explore using machine learning techniques to automate the design process of digital games. The course will cover basic and advanced topics in Artificial Intelligence and Learning, such as Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms, and Reinforcement Learning. Students will gain hands-on experience in applying these techniques in computer games. The course will also introduce psychological theories and studies about people’s decision-making and emotional processes and how they are related to the players’ experience in games. This course will take the form of a combination of lectures, presentations by students, class discussions, and independent study.

Course Description: Digital gaming is one of the most rapidly developing fields. The effort required for developing games is not trivial. To make a game fun to play, the design of the game levels and/or the AI-driven opponents need to be intelligent and adaptive to the players’ strategies and skills. In this course, students will learn and explore using machine learning techniques to automate the design process of digital games. The course will cover basic and advanced topics in Artificial Intelligence and Learning, such as Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms, and Reinforcement Learning. Students will gain hands-on experience in applying these techniques in computer games. The course will also introduce psychological theories and studies about people’s decision-making and emotional processes and how they are related to the players’ experience in games. This course will take the form of a combination of lectures, presentations by students, class discussions, and independent study.

A focus will be on hormones’ effects, mechanisms, and brain regions of interest for behavior and cognitive processes, such as perception, learning/memory, social cognition, motivation, and emotion.

Course Description: Design is and has been a means to solve problems by addressing how the materiality of form enhances function. Through a historical perspective this course will discover how design shapes, and is shaped by, culture and society. Sampling a range of fields, including graphics, architecture, and fashion, the course considers how design thinking takes on challenges from the most mundane to complex social or environmental concerns. While many see design as an artistic or decorative practice, this course will recognize the impact of design's interconnection with economics, politics, and culture.

Course Name: HISTORY OF DESIGN
Course Description: Design is and has been a means to solve problems by addressing how the materiality of form enhances function. Through a historical perspective this course will discover how design shapes, and is shaped by, culture and society. Sampling a range of fields, including graphics, architecture, and fashion, the course considers how design thinking takes on challenges from the most mundane to complex social or environmental concerns. While many see design as an artistic or decorative practice, this course will recognize the impact of design's interconnection with economics, politics, and culture.

Course Name: INTRODUCTORY ECONOMICS
Course Description: This course is designed to introduce a wide variety of concepts and applications in the broad subject of economics, economics being the study of people’s choices. Traditionally, these choices have been framed as how to best employ scarce resources to produce goods and services and distribute them for consumption. To describe these choices the cause will introduce the concepts of opportunity cost, demand and supply theory, and market structures. It will consider the role of government in making resource allocation choices. Students will also study important macroeconomic data such as gross domestic product, economic growth rates, inflation, and unemployment. Additionally, studied will be the role of money and banking in the economy and short-run events such as recessions and expansions. Overall, the course will provide the student with an encompassing view of how economic principles and concepts relate to the broader economy and society.

Course Name: INTRODUCTORY ECONOMICS
Course Description: This course is designed to introduce a wide variety of concepts and applications in the broad subject of economics, economics being the study of people’s choices. Traditionally, these choices have been framed as how to best employ scarce resources to produce goods and services and distribute them for consumption. To describe these choices the cause will introduce the concepts of opportunity cost, demand and supply theory, and market structures. It will consider the role of government in making resource allocation choices. Students will also study important macroeconomic data such as gross domestic product, economic growth rates, inflation, and unemployment. Additionally, studied will be the role of money and banking in the economy and short-run events such as recessions and expansions. Overall, the course will provide the student with an encompassing view of how economic principles and concepts relate to the broader economy and society.
