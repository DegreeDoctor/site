The courses associated with each specialization area can be found in the BME undergraduate student handbook; note that it is not necessary to choose a formal specialization to earn a BME degree, but that this is optional for students with interest in specific areas."

The Rensselaer requirements ensure the degree's breadth and its consistency with long-established Rensselaer traditions. The required Focus Track provides an opportunity for in-depth study of an ITWS application area. Focus Track options include arts, computer networking, data science, law, information security, management information systems, medicine, psychological science, web technologies and numerous others.

What is the connection between mind and body? Does God exist? What counts as knowledge? Is there only one right way to reason? Does science give us objective truth? Could computers think? Could they feel or exhibit genuine creativity? Do we have free will? How are right and wrong to be determined? Of what does the good life consist? Does life have meaning?",

      "description": "The ability to understand and predict how people act and think is more important than ever in addressing many of the greatest challenges faced as a society. At the same time, the study of behavior and mind is undergoing a rapid transformation. New technologies are continually being developed across the behavioral, data, and brain sciences. Advances in cloud and wearable computing, massive open datasets, noninvasive brain imaging, and virtual reality offer powerful new tools for understanding and predicting human thought and behavior. Psychological science is the rapidly evolving discipline that seeks to understand behavior and mind using rigorous scientific methods. Psychological scientists are trained to understand how behavior and thought are influenced by neurophysiological, emotional, cognitive, developmental, social, and environmental factors. With the benefit of emerging technologies, they are gleaning important new insights into how people learn, think, perceive, act, express emotions, make decisions, and interact with others, and applying these discoveries to improve the way people live and work.",
