Humans and most terrestrial species perceive the time of day because of their internal biological or circadian clock. This circadian clock is a network of genes and proteins that regulates daily oscillations such as sleep, hormone release, rise and fall of blood pressure and body temperature, as well as other cellular functions and physiological responses. Because of this tight regulation, a disrupted circadian clock can be detrimental to daily function and human health, as evidenced by the increased rates of disease in nightshift workers and submariners, known to experience circadian disruption. Tailored lighting intervention, on the other hand, helps adolescents fall asleep earlier, premature infants be discharged from the hospital sooner, Alzheimer's disease patients sleep better, and cancer patients experience less fatigue. Because the light people are exposed to can have a profound impact on the proper timing of their circadian clocks, it is important to effectively specify, measure and apply lighting in the built environment. It is also important to understand how various species (human, mammals, and plants) respond to light. This minor will provide the foundation to understand the basic principles of how to specify, measure, and apply light to positively impact various species, and to work side-by-side with leading experts in the field in a professional project. This minor requires four courses with a minimum of 15 credits.",

As general preparation for these courses, students should have taken ENGR 1600 Materials Science for Engineers. A list of suggested courses is given below. These are only suggestions, and courses can be chosen according to interest and scheduling. It is possible to take some courses out of sequence if the student is willing to put in the appropriate effort. Note, that some courses in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering are offered once a year, whereas some electives are offered only every other year.An excellent program for a Minor in Materials Engineering, giving students a solid foundation, would be to take Structure of Engineering Materials (MTLE 2100), plus any two of the 4-credit courses: Thermodynamics of Materials (MTLE 4100), Kinetics in Materials Science (MTLE 4150), Electrical and Optical Properties of Materials (MTLE 4200), Mechanical Properties of Materials (MTLE 4250), plus one 3-credit materials elective.",
