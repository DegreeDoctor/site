----CHANGELOG V1.0----
This is an active archival of the current state of credit requirements.
Major issues:
 - Electives being non uniform.
 - Courses not being split correctly.
 - extra objects/subdivisions messing up parsing logic.

** CURRENTLY WILL ADD BOTH REQUIREMENTS WHERE IT ASKS TO PICK ONE OF MULTIPLE
WILL NEED TO FIGURE OUT BETTER IMPLEMENTATION LATER TO AVIOD DOUBLE COUNTING**

Progress: 5/40
